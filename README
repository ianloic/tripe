This is an attempt to write simple, hopefully relatively easy to understand 
but fully featured full text indexer. It's not there yet on any of those
goals, but it does work and it's less than 250 lines of code.

tripe.py - the main library code
tripe_add.py - utility to add documents to an index
tripe_search.py - utility to search an index
tripe_dot.py - utility to visualize an index as a graphviz dot file.
